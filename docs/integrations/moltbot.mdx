title: Moltbot
---

Moltbot is a personal AI assistant that runs on your own devices. It bridges messaging services (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, iMessage, and more) to AI coding agents through a centralized gateway.

## Install

Install [Moltbot](https://molt.bot) 

```bash
npm install -g clawdbot@latest
```

Then run the onboarding wizard:

```bash
clawdbot onboard --install-daemon
```

<Note>Moltbot requires a larger context window. It is recommended to use a context window of at least 64k tokens. See [Context length](/context-length) for more information.</Note>

## Usage with Ollama

### Quick setup

```bash
ollama launch moltbot
```

This configures Moltbot to use Ollama and starts the gateway.
If the gateway is already running, no changes need to be made as the gateway will auto-reload the changes. 


To configure without launching:

```shell
ollama launch moltbot --config
```
