Once Ollama is running, run a model in another terminal session:

```
ollama run llama2
```

## Install CUDA drivers (optional â€“ for Nvidia GPUs)

[Download and install](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) CUDA.

Verify that the drivers are installed by running the following command, which should print details about your GPU:

```

```

```
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false -m -d /usr/share/ollama ollama
