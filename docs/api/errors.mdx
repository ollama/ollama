## Status codes

Endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes based on the success or failure of the request in the HTTP status line (e.g. `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` or `HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request`). Common status codes are:

- `200`: Success
- `400`: Bad Request (missing parameters, invalid JSON, etc.)
- `404`: Not Found (model doesn't exist, etc.)
- `429`: Too Many Requests (e.g. when a rate limit is exceeded)
- `500`: Internal Server Error
- `502`: Bad Gateway (e.g. when a cloud model cannot be reached)

## Error messages

Errors are returned in the `application/json` format with the following structure, with the error message in the `error` property:

```json
{
  "error": "the model failed to generate a response"
}
```

## Errors that occur while streaming

If an error occurs mid-stream, the error will be returned as an object in the `application/x-ndjson` format with an `error` property. Since the response has already started, the status code of the response will not be changed.

```json
{"model":"gemma3","created_at":"2025-10-26T17:21:21.196249Z","response":" Yes","done":false}
{"model":"gemma3","created_at":"2025-10-26T17:21:21.207235Z","response":".","done":false}
{"model":"gemma3","created_at":"2025-10-26T17:21:21.219166Z","response":"I","done":false}
{"model":"gemma3","created_at":"2025-10-26T17:21:21.231094Z","response":"can","done":false}
{"error":"an error was encountered while running the model"}
```
