title: Usage
---

Ollama's API responses include metrics that can be used for measuring performance and model usage:

* `total_duration`: How long the response took to generate
* `load_duration`: How long the model took to load
* `prompt_eval_count`: How many input tokens were processed
* `prompt_eval_duration`: How long it took to evaluate the prompt
* `eval_count`: How many output tokens were processes
* `eval_duration`: How long it took to generate the output tokens

All timing values are measured in nanoseconds.

## Example response

For endpoints that return usage metrics, the response body will include the usage fields. For example, a non-streaming call to `/api/generate` may return the following response:

```json
{
  "model": "gemma3",
  "created_at": "2025-10-17T23:14:07.414671Z",
  "response": "Hello! How can I help you today?",
  "done": true,
  "done_reason": "stop",
  "total_duration": 174560334,
  "load_duration": 101397084,
  "prompt_eval_count": 11,
  "prompt_eval_duration": 13074791,
  "eval_count": 18,
  "eval_duration": 52479709
}
```

For endpoints that return **streaming responses**, usage fields are included as part of the final chunk, where `done` is `true`.
