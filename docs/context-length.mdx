title: Context length
---

Context length is the maximum number of tokens that the model has access to in memory.  

<Note>
  The default context length in Ollama is 4096 tokens.
</Note>

Tasks which require large context like web search, agents, and coding tools should be set to at least 32000 tokens.

## Setting context length

Setting a larger context length will increase the amount of memory required to run a model. Ensure you have enough VRAM available to increase the context length.

Cloud models are set to their maximum context length by default.

### App

Change the slider in the Ollama app under settings to your desired context length.

### CLI
If editing the context length for Ollama is not possible, the context length can also be updated when serving Ollama.  
```
OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=32000 ollama serve
```

### Check allocated context length and model offloading
For best performance, use the maximum context length for a model, and avoid offloading the model to CPU. Verify the split under `PROCESSOR` using `ollama ps`.
```
ollama ps
```
```
NAME             ID              SIZE      PROCESSOR    CONTEXT    UNTIL
