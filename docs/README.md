# Documentation

Everything you need to learn about Ollama beyond the main README can be found in three main areas:

1. The documentation describes all the features and functionality of Ollama.
2. [Tutorials](./tutorials.md) apply the documentation to tasks that you want to achieve.
3. [Examples](./examples) include working tools and applications that use Ollama in interesting ways.

## Documentation Topics

Ollama is a tool for running AI models on your hardware. Many users will choose to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) to work with Ollama. You can learn more about all the commands in the CLI in the **[main README](../README.md#cli-reference)** in this GitHub Repository.

You can also choose to use the RESTful API using any language you like, including Python, JavaScript, Typescript, Go, Rust, and many more. You can learn more about using the API in the **[API Documentation](./api.md)**.

Understand how Ollama works by using the API in our **[Deep Dive](./deepdive.md)**.

You can create your own models or modify models already in the library using the Modelfile. Learn more about the Modelfile syntax in the **[Modelfile Documentation](./modelfile.md)**.

You can also import models using source model weights found on Hugging Face and similar sites by referring to the **[Import Documentation](./import.md)**.

Installing on Linux in most cases is easy using the script on Ollama.ai. To get more detail about the install, including CUDA drivers, see the **[Linux Documentation](./linux.md)**.

Many of our users like the flexibility of using our official Docker Image. You can learn more about using Docker with Ollama using the **[Docker Documentation](./docker.md)**.

It is possible to specify a directory for models, configure different hosts, and setup proxies when you use environment variables with the Ollama server. See the [Server Documentation](./server.md) to learn more about using them.

We made it really easy to install on Linux and Mac, but many of our users will choose to build Ollama on their own. If this is you, refer to the **[Development Documentation](./development.md)**.

If you encounter a problem with Ollama, the best place to start is the logs. You can find more information about them here in the **[Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.md)**.

Finally for all the questions that don't fit anywhere else, there is the **[FAQ](./faq.md)**
