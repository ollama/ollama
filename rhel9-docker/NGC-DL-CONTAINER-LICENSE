NVIDIA DEEP LEARNING CONTAINER LICENSE

This license is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA Corporation ("NVIDIA")
and governs the use of the NVIDIA container and all its contents (“CONTAINER”).

This license can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the
country in which the CONTAINER is used. If you are under the legal age of
majority, you must ask your parent or legal guardian to consent to this license.
If you are entering this license on behalf of a company or other legal entity,
you represent that you have legal authority and “you” will mean the entity you
represent.

By using the CONTAINER, you affirm that you have reached the legal age of
majority, you accept the terms of this license, and you take legal and financial
responsibility for the actions of your permitted users.

You agree to use the CONTAINER only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this
license, and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices
or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions.

1. LICENSE. Subject to the terms of this license, NVIDIA hereby grants you a
non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense (except
as expressly provided in this license) to:

a. Install and use copies of the CONTAINER, and modify and create derivative
works of samples or example source code delivered in the CONTAINER (if
applicable), to develop and test services and applications,

b. Deploy the CONTAINER on infrastructure you own or lease to offer a service to
third parties, without distributing the CONTAINER or exposing the NVIDIA APIs in
the CONTAINER directly to such service users, and

c. Develop and extend the CONTAINER to create a Compatible (as defined below)
derived CONTAINER that includes the entire CONTAINER plus other software with
primary functionality, to develop and compile applications, and distribute such
derived CONTAINER to run applications, subject to the distribution requirements
indicated in this license. As used in this section, “Compatible” means that
extensions to the CONTAINER must not adversely affect the functionality of the
other components in the CONTAINER.

2. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS. For purposes of this Section 2, the term
“distribution” also means the deployment of CONTAINERS in a service or an
application for third parties to access over the internet. These are the
distribution requirements for you to exercise the grants above:

a. A service or an application must have material additional functionality,
beyond the included portions of the CONTAINER.

b. The following notice shall be included in modifications and derivative works
of source code distributed: “This software contains source code provided by
NVIDIA Corporation.”

c. You agree to distribute the CONTAINER subject to the terms at least as
protective as the terms of this license, including (without limitation) terms
relating to the license grant, license restrictions and protection of NVIDIA’s
intellectual property rights. Additionally, you agree that you will protect the
privacy, security and legal rights of your application users.

d. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected distribution
or use of the CONTAINER not in compliance with the requirements of this license,
and to enforce the terms of your agreements with respect to the distributed
CONTAINER.

3. AUTHORIZED USERS. You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or
of your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the CONTAINER from your secure network
to perform work on your behalf. If you are an academic institution you may allow
users enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and use the
CONTAINER from your secure network. You are responsible for the compliance with
the terms of this license by your authorized users.

4. LIMITATIONS. Your license to use the CONTAINER is restricted as follows:

a. The CONTAINER may run on any computing system with or without NVIDIA GPUs,
except for the NVIDIA proprietary software (such as CUDA and TensorRT software)
in the CONTAINER which is licensed only to run on systems with NVIDIA GPUs. The
NVIDIA proprietary software in the CONTAINER may be present on systems without
NVIDIA GPUs, as long as it is not running on such systems. For components
governed by open source software licenses, see the information in the
“Components Under Other Licenses” section below.

b. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or remove copyright
or other proprietary notices from any portion of the CONTAINER or copies of the
CONTAINER.

c. Except as expressly provided in this license, you may not copy, sell, rent,
sublicense, transfer, distribute, modify, or create derivative works of any
portion of the CONTAINER. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
CONTAINER as a stand-alone product.

d. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not
indicate that a service or an application created with the CONTAINER is
sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.

e. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any technical limitation,
encryption, security, digital rights management or authentication mechanism in
the CONTAINER.

f. You may not replace any NVIDIA software components in the CONTAINER that are
governed by this license with other software that implements NVIDIA APIs.

g. You may not use the CONTAINER in any manner that would cause it to become
subject to an open source software license. As examples, licenses that require
as a condition of use, modification, and/or distribution that the CONTAINER be:
(i) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose
of making derivative works; or (iii) redistributable at no charge.

h. You acknowledge that the CONTAINER as delivered is not tested or certified by
NVIDIA for use in connection with the design, construction, maintenance, and/or
operation of any system where the use or failure of such system could result in
a situation that threatens the safety of human life or results in catastrophic
damages (each, a “Critical Application”). Examples of Critical Applications
include use in avionics, navigation, autonomous vehicle applications, ai
solutions for automotive products, military, medical, life support or other life
critical applications. NVIDIA shall not be liable to you or any third party, in
whole or in part, for any claims or damages arising from such uses. You are
solely responsible for ensuring that any product or service developed with the
CONTAINER as a whole includes sufficient features to comply with all applicable
legal and regulatory standards and requirements.

i. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its affiliates,
and their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors,
from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities,
costs or debt, fines, restitutions and expenses (including but not limited to
attorney’s fees and costs incident to establishing the right of indemnification)
arising out of or related to products or services that use the CONTAINER in or
for Critical Applications, and for use of the CONTAINER outside of the scope of
this license or not in compliance with its terms.

j. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of the
output generated using the NVIDIA proprietary software (such as CUDA and
TensorRT software) in the CONTAINER for the purpose of translating such output
artifacts to target a non-NVIDIA platform.

5. UPDATES. NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or
other updates to this CONTAINER. Unless the updates are provided with their
separate governing terms, they are deemed part of the CONTAINER licensed to you
as provided in this license. You agree that the form and content of the
CONTAINER that NVIDIA provides may change without prior notice to you. While
NVIDIA generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may in some
cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in future versions of the
CONTAINER.

6. PRE-RELEASE VERSIONS. CONTAINER versions identified as alpha, beta, preview,
early access or otherwise as pre-release may not be fully functional, may
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security,
privacy, availability, and reliability standards relative to commercial versions
of NVIDIA software and materials. You may use a pre- release CONTAINER version
at your own risk, understanding that these versions are not intended for use in
production or business-critical systems. NVIDIA may choose not to make available
a commercial version of any pre-release CONTAINER. NVIDIA may also choose to
abandon development and terminate the availability of a pre-release CONTAINER at
any time without liability.

7. COMPONENTS UNDER OTHER LICENSES. The CONTAINER may include NVIDIA or
third-party components with separate legal notices or terms as may be described
in proprietary notices accompanying the CONTAINER. If and to the extent there is
a conflict between the terms in this license and the license terms associated
with the component, the license terms associated with the components control
only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict. For example, some Triton
components (such as the Triton Inference Server) are governed by open source
software licenses.

You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to obtain any
additional third-party licenses required to make, have made, use, have used,
sell, import, and offer for sale your products or services that include or
incorporate any third- party software and content relating to audio and/or video
encoders and decoders from, including but not limited to, Microsoft, Thomson,
Fraunhofer IIS, Sisvel S.p.A., MPEG-LA, and Coding Technologies. NVIDIA does not
grant to you under this license any necessary patent or other rights with
respect to any audio and/or video encoders and decoders. Subject to the other
terms of this license, you may use the CONTAINER to develop and test
applications released under Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source
software licenses.

8. OWNERSHIP.

9. FEEDBACK. You may, but are not obligated to, provide to NVIDIA suggestions,
fixes, modifications, feature requests or other feedback regarding the CONTAINER
(“Feedback”). Feedback, even if designated as confidential by you, shall not
create any confidentiality obligation for NVIDIA. NVIDIA and its designees have
a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use, reproduce,
publicly display, modify, create derivative works of, license, sublicense, and
otherwise distribute and exploit Feedback as NVIDIA sees fit without payment and
without obligation or restriction of any kind on account of intellectual
property rights or otherwise.
