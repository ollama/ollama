    "# Trace your local Ollama model with Langfuse\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we will show you how to trace local language models with Ollama and Langfuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: We'll use the Langfuse OpenAI SDK integration for Python in this example. This works the same for [JS/TS](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/openai/js/get-started) or via the Langfuse integrations with [LangChain](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langchain/tracing) and [LlamaIndex](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/llama-index/get-started).**\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Langfuse?\n",
    "\n",
    "Langfuse ([GitHub](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse)) is an open-source platform designed for LLM engineering. It enables teams to collaboratively debug, analyze, and improve their LLM applications through tracing, prompt management, and evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Ollama?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ollama ([GitHub](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)) is an open-source platform that allows you to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your machine, supporting a variety of models including [Llama 3.1](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1) and [Mistral 7B](https://ollama.com/library/mistral). It optimizes setup and configuration by bundling model weights, configuration, and data into a single package defined by a Modelfile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Deployment of Langfuse\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you can also locally deploy Langfuse to run models and trace LLM outputs only on your own device. [Here](https://langfuse.com/docs/deployment/local) is a guide on how to run Langfuse on your local machine using Docker Compose. This method is ideal for testing Langfuse and troubleshooting integration issues.\n",

    "For this example, we will use the Langfuse cloud version."
