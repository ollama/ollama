## Development

### Desktop App

go run ./cmd/app
```

### UI Development

#### Setup

Install required tools:

```bash
go install github.com/tkrajina/typescriptify-golang-structs/tscriptify@latest
```

#### Develop UI (Development Mode)

1. Start the React development server (with hot-reload):

```bash
cd ui/app
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. In a separate terminal, run the Ollama app with the `-dev` flag:

```bash
go generate ./... &&
OLLAMA_DEBUG=1 go run ./cmd/app -dev
```

The `-dev` flag enables:

- Loading the UI from the Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173
- Fixed UI server port at http://127.0.0.1:3001 for API requests
- CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Hot-reload support for UI development
